This [flash Videocart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_cartridge) allows games to be loaded from an SD card and played on a real Fairchild Channel F. It's powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico, as well as two 74LVC245 ICs (5V -> 3.3V) and a 74HCT541 IC (3.3V -> 5V) for level conversion. This project is currently in development.

# Getting Started

To install games, simply drag and drop your **.bin** files onto an SD card*, and insert it into the flash Videocart.

> *The SD card must be formatted as FAT32 

Then you insert the flash Videocart into your Channel F as you would a normal Videocart, and select the game you want to play from the menu.

# PCB

This is currently in development

# Videocart Case

The Videocart case is 3D printed as three seperate pieces then assembled.
