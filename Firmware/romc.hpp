 * \brief Emulates a 3853 Static Memory Interface with 62K of memory 
 * 
 * \details The 3853 Static Memory Interface (SMI) provided all necessary address 
 * lines and control signals to interface up to 65,536 bytes of memory to an F8
 * microcomputer system. It was used by the Chess Videocart to interface regular
 * RAM/ROM ICs. Its functionality is emulated below with 62K of memory available
 * from 0x800 to 0xFFFF.
 * 
 * Refer to the 3853 SMI datasheet for more information.
